# war_card_game
The card game of War can be played in seconds.
  
Completed in April, 2021 using IntelliJ IDEA.

Built from scratch using Enums to hold rank and suit values.
Game checks for hands that won't be able to play the next card faceup to determine a winner.

Uncomment the following lines of code in Game.java to see each player's hand after each card flip: 

hand.printPlayer1Hand();
hand.printPlayer2Hand();

Some methods and implimentations of methods were left commented out simply for testing and a follow up iteration using a GUI.
